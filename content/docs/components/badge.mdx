<ComponentPreview name="badge-demo" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Badge } from "@soar-design/soar-react-components";

<Badge variant="default | outline | secondary | destructive">Badge</Badge>;
```

### Link

You can use the `asChild` prop to make another component look like a badge. Here's an example of a link that looks like a badge.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";

import { Badge } from "@soar-design/soar-react-components";

export function LinkAsBadge() {
  return (
    <Badge asChild>
      <Link href="/">Badge</Link>
    </Badge>
  );
}
```
